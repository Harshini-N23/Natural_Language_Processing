## 1. Basics of NLP

### **Synonyms and Antonyms**

This program explores NLTK's lexical resources to find synonyms (words with similar meanings) and antonyms (words with opposite meanings) for given words. It helps expand your vocabulary and understand word relationships.

### **Text Vectorization**

Learn how to convert textual data into numerical vectors, a crucial step for machine learning with text. Techniques like Bag of Words and  TF-IDF  are covered to represent words as features.

### **N-Gram Models**

N-grams are contiguous sequences of N items (usually words) from a given sample of text. This program demonstrates how to use N-grams for language modeling, text prediction, and understanding text patterns. This program mainly focussed on predicting the next word in the sentence given the preceeding n-words.

### **Parts of Speech Tagging**

Part-of-speech (POS) tagging involves assigning a part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to each word in a sentence. The program has been implemented using the Hidden Markov Model to find the POS tags by calculating the Transition and the Emission Probabilities

### **Word2Vec Embeddings**

Dive into Word2Vec, an algorithm for learning word embeddings that capture semantic relationships between words. Word embeddings are critical for many NLP applications, including word similarity and document classification. We have used the Gensim library.

### **Parse Tree**

Explore the structure of sentences using parse trees generated by NLTK. This program helps you understand how sentences are syntactically constructed.

## 2. Applications of NLP

### **Text Classification**

Build text classification models using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB). Text classification is used for tasks like sentiment analysis and spam detection.

### **Text Clustering**

Learn how to cluster similar text documents together using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Text clustering helps in organizing and summarizing large text corpora.

### **Topic Modelling using LDA**

Apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling in text data. LDA helps identify topics within a collection of documents, making it useful for content recommendation and information retrieval.

### **Topic Modelling using LSA and NMF**

Explore Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for topic modeling. These techniques are alternatives to LDA for discovering underlying topics in text

### **Text Summarization**

Automatic text summarization condenses long documents into shorter versions while preserving essential information. This program covers techniques like extractive and abstractive summarization.

### **Named Entity Recognition**

Named Entity Recognition is used to identify and classify named entities (e.g., names of people, organizations, locations) within text. NER is crucial for information extraction and text understanding.
